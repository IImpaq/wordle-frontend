# Wordle Frontend
This project is a replication of the popular Wordle game. It was made to improve
my web development skills and further extend my toolset after completing the
[FullStackOpen course](https://github.com/IImpaq/fullstackopen).

## Developing
To work on the project, start a development server:
```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building
To create a production version of your app:
```bash
npm run build
```
You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
> To deploy the app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
